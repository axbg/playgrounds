The application implements the OAuth2 Authorization Code with PKCE flow, and then it calls a resource-server, passing the obtained access token as a Bearer Token. 

It uses Keycloak as Identity Provider and the [oidc-client-resource-server app](https://github.com/axbg/playgrounds/tree/main/java/spring/oidc-client-and-resource-server) as the BE server.
